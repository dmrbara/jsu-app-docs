## AI Coding Tools

We recommend using AI-assisted coding tools to boost productivity:

| Tool | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Cursor | Primary tool |
| Claude Code | Primary tool |
| Copilot | Alternative |

| Codex | Alternative |

Use whatever tool you have access to, the key is having AI assistance available.
