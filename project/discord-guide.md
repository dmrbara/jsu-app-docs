## Daily Standups

Post your update in `#standups` each working day:

```
**Yesterday:** What you finished
**Today:** What you're working on
**Blockers:** Anything stopping you (or "None")
```

**Example:**
> **Yesterday:** Finished login screen UI [JSU-12]
> **Today:** Starting auth hook [JSU-13]
> **Blockers:** Waiting on Figma for error states

## Guidelines

- **Keep discussions in the right channel.** Code stuff in `#dev`, design stuff in `#design`.
- **Use threads** for longer conversations to keep channels readable.
- **Tag people or roles** when you need a response, but don't overdo it.
- **Post blockers immediately** and don't wait for standup if you're stuck.
- **Mute channels** you don't need constant notifications from, deep work matters more than real-time chat.
